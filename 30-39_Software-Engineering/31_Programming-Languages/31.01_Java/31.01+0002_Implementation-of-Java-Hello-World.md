# Implementation of Java Hello World

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    // Program begins with call to main()
    public static void main(String[] args) {

      // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

## Understanding the Java Hello World Program

### Class Definition

Every Java Program must have at least one class.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    // Statements go here
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the class is `public`, the filename must match the class name
> `HelloWorld.java`

### `main` Method

In the Java Programming Language, every application must contain a `main()` method
as it is the entry point of the application.

```java
public static void main (String[] args)
```

- **`public`**: Allows JVM to access the method from anywhere.
- **`static`**: Method can run without creating the object.
- **`void`**: It doesn't return any value.
- **`String[] args`**: Accepts command-line arguments.

### `System.out.println()`

This prints output to the console.

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World");
```

- **`System`**: Built-in class from `java.lang` package.
- **`out`**: Static member (PrintStream object) of System.
- **`println()`**: Method that prints to console and moves to the next line.
