### Things that I learned

- The mindset of adding Javadoc Comments. I should explain why I implement them
  and what it does with set of expectations on what it'll return and/or throw.

- A little bit of Public Key Certification and its usage to SSL Connections.

### Questions/Confusing Event

- Still confused on how to initiate creating a Javadoc Comment or how to
  implement the Javadoc Comment itself.
